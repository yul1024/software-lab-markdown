# markdown-lab

This is a lab I did before when I was learning software development. from where I stand now, this project was poorly done. But at that time, I finished this project independently and learned object-oriented development and design patterns through this project. This project also has related UML design and testing works, but it is not important, here is just as a record.

这是我之前在学习软件开发的时候做的一个lab。从现在的立场看，这个项目做得很糟糕。不过当时我独立完成了这个项目，通过这个项目学会了面向对象的开发和设计模式。这个项目还有相关的UML设计和测试工程，不过这都不重要了，这里只是作为记录。
